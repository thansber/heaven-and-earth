Heaven and Earth Web Application
================================
A long time ago, I played an amazing game called Heaven & Earth for the PC and I decided to try to ressurect some of the puzzles in the game as an HTML5 web application.

I plan to start with the Illusions and see how far I get.  The Pendulum seems to be a VERY daunting task and I doubt I will ever even attempt it.
